# .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.

# example.tfvars
terraform.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
#
# !example_override.tf
